# Discord-Weather-Bot

Weather Bot is a friendly bot that provides the weather in straightforward responses, and has the ability to give you a **TON** of weather-related information about that location.

If you need to know the humidity of Berlin, or any alerts in Edmonton, Weather Bot has got your back! With simple and easy to use commands, you'll know in a *breeze* (heehee you can ask for the wind speed too) !

If you don't feel like typing in your location every time, simply set your location with /setlocation and the inputted location will be passed in every other command you use! You may also change your C/F unit!

I hope you enjoy using this bot and that is comes in handy! Check out the full list of commands on the bot website on the side bar!
If you need any help of have some inquiries about the bot, feel free to email kbeanstudios@gmail.com!
